In this repository I am saving my solutions to the mathematical and
computer scientific problems hosted on:

https://projecteuler.net/archives

For each problem there is a dedicated script which nomenclature
follows the semantics 'prob<4-digit problem number>.py'. Furthermore
there are following files in this repository:

- probxxxx.py: up-to-date template for solution scripts.
- help_functions.py: contains frequently used functions
