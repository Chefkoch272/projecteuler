# About

In this repository I am saving my solution paths to the mathematical and
computer scientific problems of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

# Tasks

- [ ] Run all riddles (from prob0002.py on) and fill in solutions to new Project Euler account.
- [ ] Add default values to scripts so that calling a script without arguments uses the riddle's actual values.
